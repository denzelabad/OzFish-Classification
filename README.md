# OzFish-Classification
This is a video classification project that uses a Convolutional Neural Network to identify a variety of fish species in underwater research videos. Baited Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS) are a tool used to monitor and survey fish in a variety of underwater habitats, and involve lowering stationary video cameras rigged with bait to the seafloor that attract and record nearby fish. After chancing upon an online livestream of one of these BRUVS I thought it would be far more interesting and educational if there were a way to identify the fish in the livestream, as they normally just consist of raw footage with no commentary or labels. I figured I could apply what I'd learned about computer vision to try and create a solution to that problem.
