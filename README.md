# Fish Video Classification
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network to attempt to identify a variety of fish species in underwater research videos. 

Baited Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS) are a tool used to monitor and survey fish in a variety of underwater habitats, and involve lowering stationary video cameras rigged with bait to the seafloor to attract and record nearby fish. After discovering a few online livestreams of these BRUVS I found myself in awe of how interesting some fish looked and was constantly wondering what species of fish were being shown, as the livestreams normally consisted of raw footage with no commentary or labels. Instead of scouring Google trying to figure out the species of each fish, I figured I could apply what I'd learned about machine learning to try and create a deep learning model that would help solve that problem.
