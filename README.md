# Fish Video Classification
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network to attempt to identify a variety of fish species in underwater research videos. 

Baited Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS) are a tool used to monitor and survey fish in a variety of underwater habitats, and involve lowering stationary video cameras rigged with bait to the seafloor to attract and record nearby fish. Occasionally I would run into online livestreams of these BRUVS where they would feature a number of extremely interesting-looking fish, but weren't supplemented with commentary or any labels so the fish couldn't be identified. I figured these would be much more interesting and educational if they automatically identified each fish that would show up in the frame. Using my knowledge of machine learning and computer vision I decided to try and provide a solution to that problem.

This project uses the Ozfish dataset for testing and training which can be found [here](https://github.com/open-AIMS/ozfish). It consists of over 80k image crops of hundreds of species of fish taken from a BRUVS program, including an associated metadata file that links each fish crop with its species, genus and family.
